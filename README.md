# HuffmanEncoder
<h2> Notes </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Input file is read, HashMap stores frequencies, ArrayList encapsulates data in nodes then is turned into Huffman Tree which encodes characters. <li>
  <li> Created for Data Structures class in March 2020. </li>
  <li> Doesn't actually perform sophisticated binary manipulation - rather it replaces each character with its huffman encoded binary equivalent (so a series of the characters "1" and "0". This means the "encoded" file actually takes up more space than the original file ("truncated" - named as such because it's not the whole Little Women book, just part of it). But, it's really the idea that counts in terms of generating the Huffman encoding. </li>
</ul>
